## Project set up
To set up the project the following were used: Node js, Webstorm, Mysql, Postman. Jquery and Ajax are both used to connect the front end and the back end, the language that is mostly used for this is javascript. For the user interface, the code was run through VS code with the code runner extension. Code runner allows you to run the code, works as a compiler.

## Requirements
A PC that has a 4GB RAM, Core i3 and Mysql will be used as a local server. 
A device that can run a web browser. 
The IDE used is Netbeans but any IDE that can run php can be used as long as Xampp php interpreter is installed within the IDE.

### Running the tests
We used codecov and coveralls to run tests and see our code coverage. 
A test that has been done is for data extraction from the tables that have been created.
